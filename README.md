Burns Depression Checklist (BDC)

Burns Depression Checklist (BDC) was developed by David D. Burns, an American Psychiatrist.
It is a 25-item rating scale which asks an individual to rate their thoughts and feelings,
activities and personal relationships, physical symptoms, and suicidal urges. 
For instance, you would be asked how much you have experienced “guilt or shame”
during the past week with the options “not at all, somewhat, moderately, a lot, and extremely”.
